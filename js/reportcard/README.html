<p>This is a Report Card widget for tracking your online coding school progress. </p>
<p>I started this project after posting about a pretty simple widget I had been working on back when Treehouse only had a facebook group as a forum, to see if anyone else had thought about embedding their &quot;Report Card&quot; on their personal site. Since there seemed to be some stellar interest, I have been working on this current version of the Report Card Widget as a side project for a number of months now. It has finally come together pretty well, and I am excited to announce version 1.0 of the Coding Report Card!</p>
